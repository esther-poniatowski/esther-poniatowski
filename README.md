I am @esther-poniatowski.

I am interested in theoretical modeling in cognitive neurosciences. 
Specifically, I focus on the way populations of neurons encode and represent information, in a 'geometric' abstract space defined by their joint activity.

My main goal is to investigate and understand coding principles in networks, may they be artifical or biological.
In my work, I use mathematical tools and computer sciences. I usually code in python. 
I also analyse experimental data (neurophysiological recordings of single neurons in behaving animals).
