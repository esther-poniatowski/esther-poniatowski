The overall goal of this work is to investigate how neuronal networks (biological and artificial) encode and represent information.
Secifically, it aims to understand better how those network can produce *context-dependent* behaviors. 
In other words, how does contextual information influence the processing of identical input stimuli, up to lead to different outputs ?
This question is tackled in two steps:
1. Data analysis of neurophysiological recordings of single neurons in behaving animals.
2. Theoretical Modeling of information coding in the framework of low-rank networks.
