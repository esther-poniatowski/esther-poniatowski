Hello, I am @esther-poniatowski.

I am interested in theoretical modeling in cognitive neurosciences. 
Specifically, I focus on the way populations of neurons encode and represent information (sensory, decision variables) in a 'geometric' abstract space defined by their joint activity.

I am currently learning cognitive neurosciences and mathematical tools.

I am looking to collaborate on modeling neurophysiological data (single units recordings in behaving animals or humans), behavioral data, and on building models of population coding.
